//DATA TYPE CONVERSION
/*
 Sometime we want to convert our data into another datatype and we can do it by easily like
 let age = 18
 console.log(typeof(age))
 In output it give use number

 suppose i want to convert that into string so thats how i do it
 let agee = "18"    
 now in that case it give us the string 
 so we can covert that in to the another datayep
 let value = Number(agee)
 console.log(typeof(agee))
*/

let age = "34"
console.log(typeof( age))
let value = Number(age)
console.log(typeof value)
