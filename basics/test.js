/*
 var ->used for variable decleration and and its scope is unlimited 
let -> scope is limited to function block but it dont allow to update its varaible value
const-> this is used for permanently decleration of a variable value 
*/


//  DATA TYPES 
/*
string
number
boolean 
undefined -> its datatype is also undefined . Its show on output when we dont declare the value of a variable
NUll -> it type is object . Thats a value which is 0

//DATA TYPE CONVERSION

/*
                     STRING TO NUMBER
 Sometime we want to convert our data into another datatype and we can do it by easily like
 let age = 18
 console.log(typeof(age))
 In output it give use number

 suppose i want to convert that into string so thats how i do it
 let agee = "18"    
 now in that case it give us the string 
 so we can covert that in to the another datayep
 let value = Number(agee)
 console.log(typeof(agee))
*/

let age = "34"
console.log(typeof( age))
let value = Number(age)
console.log(typeof value)



/*
NAN : not a number 
Null : in ouput it give 0
Undefined : the value not defined
Boolean : output is 0 or 1
if we want to conver the string in to the number it give NAN (not a number )




but if we write 1 in a varaibale and want to convert that number in boolean type then on output it show us true
                    ANY NUMBER TO  BOOLEAN CONVERTER
0=> false
1=> Ture
" " => false
"alisah" => True 




                   STRING TO NUMBER
 let val = "alisha"
 let value = String(val)
 console.log(value)
